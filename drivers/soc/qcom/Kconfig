config QCOM_GSBI
        tristate "QCOM General Serial Bus Interface"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable GSBI support.  The GSBI provides control
          functions for connecting the underlying serial UART, SPI, and I2C
          devices to the output pins.

config QCOM_SCM
        bool

config QCOM_TCSR
        tristate "QCOM Top Control and Status Registers"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable TCSR support.  The TCSR provides control
          functions for various peripherals.

config QCOM_RESTART_REASON
        bool "Write restart reason on reboot"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable writing restart reason. This adds a reboot handler
          to write the restart reason command to distinguish between normal and
          abnormal reboots. This also registers for panic notification so that
          magic cookies can be set for download mode.
          If unsure, say N

config QCOM_DLOAD_MODE
        bool "Enable download mode on crashes"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        default n
        help
          This makes the SoC enter download mode when it resets
          due to a kernel panic. Note that this doesn't by itself
          make the kernel reboot on a kernel panic - that must be
          enabled via another mechanism.
          If unsure, say N

config QCOM_DLOAD_MODE_APPSBL
        bool "Application bootloader based download mode handling"
        depends on QCOM_DLOAD_MODE
        default n
        help
          Select this if application bootloader, for example U-Boot, will handle
          download mode due to kernel panic.
          If unsure, say N
