QCA Wakeup Q6-WCSS Remoteproc Driver
=====================================

The IPQ807x family of devices uses a Q6-WCSS DSP co-processor. The Q6-WCSS
requires a firmware binary to boot. The q6-wcss remoteproc driver handles
the loading of firmware and booting of q6-wcss.

Q6v5 WCSS Device Node:
======================
A q6v5-wcss device node is used to represent the Q6-WCSS processor
instance within the SoC. It is needed as child node to SOC parent node
through which it is accessible to the IPQ807x.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be one of,
				"qcom,q6v5-wcss-rproc" for IPQ807x SoCs
- reg:			Should contain the address ranges for the Q6-WCSS
			internal memory regions, QDSP6SS_PUB. The parent node
			should provide an appropriate range property for
			properly translating these into bus addresses.
- firmware:		Name of firmware file to be used for loading and
			booting the q6-wcss remote processor.

Example:
--------
/* IPQ807x */
soc {
	q6v5_wcss@0x0AD00000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rproc-q6v5-wcss";
		firmware = "q6-wcss-boot";
		reg = <0xC900000 0x4040>;
	};
	...
};
