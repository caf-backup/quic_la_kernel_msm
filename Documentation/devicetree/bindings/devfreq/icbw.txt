Interconnect bandwidth device

icbw is a device that represents an interconnect path that connects two
devices. This device is typically used to vote for BW requirements between
two devices. Eg: CPU to DDR, GPU to DDR, etc

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "devfreq-icbw"
- interconnects:	Pairs of phandles and interconnect provider specifier
			to denote the edge source and destination ports of
			the interconnect path. See also:
		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interconnect/interconnect.txt
- operating-points-v2:  A phandle to an OPP v2 table that holds meaningful
			bandwidth values (in MB/s) that can be requested for
			the interconnect path. The list of meaningful
			bandwidth values depend on multiple propertied of
			each segment of the interconnect path like list of
			supported frequencies, interconnect width,
			interconnect architecture, etc.

Example:

        bw_opp_table: bw-opp-table {
                compatible = "operating-points-v2";
                opp-75  {
                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <  572 >; /*  75 MHz */
                };
                opp-150 {
                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 < 1144 >; /* 150 MHz */
                };
                opp-200 {
                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 < 1525 >; /* 200 MHz */
                };
                opp-307 {
                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 < 2342 >; /* 307 MHz */
                };
                opp-460 {
                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 < 3509 >; /* 460 MHz */
                };
                opp-614 {
                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 < 4684 >; /* 614 MHz */
                };
                opp-800 {
                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 < 6103 >; /* 800 MHz */
                };
                opp-931 {
                        opp-hz = /bits/ 64 < 7102 >; /* 931 MHz */
                };
        };
