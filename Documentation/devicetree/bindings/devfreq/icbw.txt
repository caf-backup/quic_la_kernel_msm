Interconnect bandwidth device

icbw is a device that represents an interconnect path that connects two
devices. This device is typically used to vote for BW requirements between
two devices. Eg: CPU to DDR, GPU to DDR, etc

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "devfreq-icbw"
- interconnects:	Pairs of phandles and interconnect provider specifier
			to denote the edge source and destination ports of
			the interconnect path. See also:
		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interconnect/interconnect.txt
- interconnect-names:	Must have one entry with the name "path".

Example:

	qcom,cpubw {
		compatible = "devfreq-icbw";
		interconnects = <&snoc MASTER_APSS_1 &bimc SLAVE_EBI_CH0>;
		interconnect-names = "path";
	};
