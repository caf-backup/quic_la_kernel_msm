* Qualcomm AHCI SATA Controller

SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
Each SATA controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible		: compatible list, contains "qcom,msm-ahci"
- interrupts		: <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
- reg			: <registers mapping>
- phys			: Must contain exactly one entry as specified
			  in phy-bindings.txt
- phy-names		: Must be "sata-phy"

Required properties for "qcom,ipq806x-ahci" compatible:
- clocks		: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names		: Shall be:
				"slave_iface" - Fabric port AHB clock for SATA
				"iface" - AHB clock
				"core" - core clock
				"rxoob" - RX out-of-band clock
				"pmalive" - Power Module Alive clock

Example:
	sata@29000000 {
		compatible = "qcom,ipq806x-ahci", "qcom,msm-ahci";
		reg = <0x29000000 0x180>;

		interrupts = <0 209 0x0>;

		clocks = <&gcc SFAB_SATA_S_H_CLK>,
			 <&gcc SATA_H_CLK>,
			 <&gcc SATA_A_CLK>,
			 <&gcc SATA_RXOOB_CLK>,
			 <&gcc SATA_PMALIVE_CLK>;
		clock-names = "slave_iface", "iface", "core",
				"rxoob", "pmalive";

		phys = <&sata_phy>;
		phy-names = "sata-phy";
	};
