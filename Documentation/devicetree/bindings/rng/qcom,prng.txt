Qualcomm MSM pseudo random number generator.

Required properties:

- compatible  : should be "qcom,prng"
- reg         : specifies base physical address and size of the registers map
- clocks      : phandle to clock-controller plus clock-specifier pair
- clock-names : "core" clocks all registers, FIFO and circuits in PRNG IP block
- qcom,no-prng-config : Skip prng configuration if its done on secure side
- qcom,bandwidth-min  : to feed minimum bandwidth value
- qcom,bandwidth-max  : to feed maximum bandwidth value

Example:

	rng@f9bff000 {
		compatible = "qcom,prng";
		reg = <0xf9bff000 0x200>;
		clocks = <&clock GCC_PRNG_AHB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "core";
		qcom,no-prng-config;
		qcom,bandwidth-min = <0>;
		qcom,bandwidth-max = <800>;
	};
