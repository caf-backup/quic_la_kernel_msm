Master data plane driver for the QCA networking subsystem (NSS)

Required properties:
- device_type: = "network";
- compatible: = should be "qcom,nss-dp";
- qcom,id: Unique Identifier for the GMAC block. This field is unique identifier
		for each physical port.
- reg: Base address and size for the Qcom/Synopsys Mac Register space
- qcom,mactype: = 0 for Qcom GMAC, 1 for Synopsys GMAC.
- local-mac-address: MAC Address to be used at the time of interface
			initialization

Example:

dp1 {
	device_type = "network";
	compatible = "qcom,nss-dp";
	qcom,id = <1>;
	reg = <0x3a001000 0x200>;
	qcom,mactype = <0>;
	local-mac-address = [000000000000];
};
