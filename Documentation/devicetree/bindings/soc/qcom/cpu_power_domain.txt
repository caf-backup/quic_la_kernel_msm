Qualcomm Technologies cpu power domain
-----------------------------------------

CPU power domain handles the tasks that need to be performed during
application processor deeper low power mode entry for QCOM SoCs which
have hardened IP blocks combinedly called as RPMH (Resource Power Manager
Hardened) for shared resource management. Flushing the buffered requests
to TCS (Triggered Command Set) in RSC (Resource State Coordinator) and
programming the wakeup timer in PDC (Power Domain Controller) for timer
based wakeup are handled as part of domain power down.

The bindings for cpu power domain is specified in the RSC section in
devicetree.

Properties:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be "qcom,cpu-pm-domain".

- #power-domain-cells: number of cells in power domain specifier;
    must be 0.

Node of a device using power domains must have a power-domains property
defined with a phandle to respective power domain.

Example:

	apps_rsc: rsc@179c0000 {
		[...]
		cpu_pd: power-domain-controller {
			compatible = "qcom,cpu-pm-domain";
			#power-domain-cells = <0>;
		};
	};


See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt for description
of consumer-side bindings.
