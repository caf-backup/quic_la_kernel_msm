* QPIC LCD node

Required properties:
- compatible:		"qcom,mdss_qpic"
- reg:			QPIC LCD register address range
- clocks:		must contain core clock and always on clock
- clock-names:		must contain "core" for the core clock and "aon" for the
			always on clock
- dmas:			DMA specifier, consisting of a phandle BAM DMA
			controller node and the channel number to
			be used for LCD. Refer to dma.txt and
			qcom_bam_dma.txt for more details

Example:

qcom_mdss_qpic@7980000 {
	compatible = "qcom,mdss_qpic";
	reg = <0x7980000 0x24000>;
	interrupts = <0 106 0>;
	clocks = <&gcc GCC_QPIC_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_QPIC_AHB_CLK>;
	clock-names = "core", "aon";
	dmas = <&qpic_bam 6>;
};
